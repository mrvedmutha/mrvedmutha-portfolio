---

### **Design Specifications & Guidelines**

#### **1. Overall Layout & Structure**

*   **Fixed Header/Navigation:** The top navigation bar (logo, Home, Services, Projects, Blogs, Testimonials, Contact Me button) should remain fixed at the top of the viewport for easy access, even when scrolling.
*   **Section-Based Layout:** The site is divided into distinct sections (About, Vision & Mission, My Award Winning Journey, Let's Talk for Your Next Projects, Footer). Each section should have clear visual separation.
*   **Full-Width Sections:** Most sections, particularly the "Vision & Mission" and "My Award Winning Journey" and "Let's Talk" sections, span the full width of the browser.
*   **Centered Content:** Content within each section is centrally aligned and constrained to a maximum width (e.g., 1200px - 1400px) to ensure readability and balance on larger screens, with appropriate horizontal padding.

#### **2. Color Palette**

*   **Primary Green:** `#4A6034` (Dark Olive Green - Used for background, footer, some text, and icons)
*   **Secondary Yellow:** `#FBB03B` (Bright Gold/Orange - Used for accents, buttons, highlights, and active states)
*   **Neutral Gray/White:** `#FFFFFF` (Pure White - Backgrounds, primary text)
*   **Light Gray:** `#F0F0F0` (Very light gray - Used for subtle backgrounds, dividers, and card backgrounds)
*   **Dark Text:** `#333333` (Off-black for primary text)
*   **Muted Text:** `#666666` (For secondary text, descriptions)

#### **3. Typography**

*   **Headings (H1, H2, H3):**
    *   **Font Family:** A modern sans-serif, similar to Montserrat or Poppins. (e.g., "Montserrat", sans-serif)
    *   **Weight:** Bold (700) for H1/H2, Semi-Bold (600) for H3.
    *   **Color:** Dark text (`#333333`), with some emphasis on yellow (`#FBB03B`) for key words.
*   **Body Text/Paragraphs:**
    *   **Font Family:** A readable sans-serif, similar to Open Sans or Lato. (e.g., "Open Sans", sans-serif)
    *   **Weight:** Regular (400).
    *   **Color:** Muted text (`#666666`).
    *   **Line Height:** Generous (e.g., 1.6 - 1.8) for readability.
*   **Navigation/Buttons:**
    *   **Font Family:** Similar to body text or heading font for consistency.
    *   **Weight:** Medium (500) or Semi-Bold (600).
    *   **Color:** White (`#FFFFFF`) on dark backgrounds, dark text on white backgrounds.

#### **4. Imagery & Icons**

*   **Hero Image:** A prominent, high-quality, professional photograph of the individual, ideally with a blurred or minimal background to keep the focus. The image in the "About Me" section (left side) is key.
*   **Icons:**
    *   **Style:** Line icons with a clean, modern aesthetic.
    *   **Color:** Predominantly yellow (`#FBB03B`) for interactive elements, or dark green/white for other uses.
    *   **Usage:** Used to visually break up content (e.g., stars in skills section, award icons, contact icons).
*   **Video Placeholder:** The "Our Vision and Mission" section includes a video player placeholder. Ensure this is implemented correctly, perhaps using a light-box or embedded player.

*   The design must be fully responsive across all major devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Breakpoints:** Standard breakpoints (e.g., 1200px, 992px, 768px, 576px) should be considered.
*   **Mobile Adaptations:**
    *   Navigation should collapse into a hamburger menu.
    *   Content columns should stack vertically.
    *   Image sizes and text scaling should be optimized for smaller screens.
    *   Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized for mobile.

#### **8. Interactive Elements & Animations**
